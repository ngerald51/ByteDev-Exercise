Factorial.py
The factorial of a number is the product of that number and all the numbers below it
For example, the factorial of 5 will be: * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
A function was written that will take a number as an argument.
It should return the factorial of that number.

Fibonnanci.py:
A function that takes in a number.
This function should print the Fibonacci Sequence up to, but not including, that number.
Each number should be printed on a new line.

Palindrom.py
A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be spelled the same way forwards and backwards. The following words and phrases are all palindromes:

"a car, a man, a maraca"
"kayak"
"racecar"
 Its a function that takes in a string as an argument
If the string is the same forward as it is backward the function will return True.
Otherwise the function will return False.

Scramble.py
A function that will take two arguments.
Both arguments will be strings.
The function will return a list containing all the letters found in both strings.
All the letters returned should be lowercase. There should be no duplicate letters in the list returned by your funciton.

PrimeFactor.py
The largest prime factor of a integer is the largest prime number than can divide the integer into another integer.
A function that will take an integer as an argument. The function will return the largest prime factor of the passed in integer.
If the integer is prime itself, then it is the largest prime factor of itself.

Que2Stack.py
 an abstract data type that maintains the order in which elements were added to it, allowing the oldest elements to be removed from the front and new elements to be added to the rear. This is called a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure because the first element added to the queue (i.e., the one that has been waiting the longest) is always the first one to be removed.

A basic queue with the following operations
Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.
In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process  queries, where each query is one of the following  types:

1 x: Enqueue element  into the end of the queue.
2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
